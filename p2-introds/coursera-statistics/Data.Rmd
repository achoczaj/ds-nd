This data is collected from Federal Election Commission, http://www.fec.gov/ . This site is official US government, and write detail about 2012 US presidential election.This data has contributors' identity such as id,name,occupation,city,status, employer, contribution amount, etc.This data can be downloaded at this [link](ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/Presidential_Map/2012/P00000001/P00000001-NY.zip).This is a must written survey by all contributors that want to donate for candidates' campaign.

One contributors can submit more than once. Since I only pay attention to the contributors only, I drop dupplicate the contributors, so the cases are 378562 unique contributors. The variables that will be focused on are contributors' zipcodes(categorical, various levels) and candidate name(categorical, various levels).

This is observational study. The data is collected from must filled survey by contributors,not computer, as there's some city that is the same but two different things ("North Hills, " vs "North Hills"). There are total of 2207 cities in dataset as opposed to 62 New York cities the original number.

It can generalized to all New York financial contributions in 2012, but only for those New Yorkers that contribute to presidential election. This data can't be generalized to others that perhaps not enough money to contribute, or other  reasons. This can be some extraneous variables that prevent the survey to generalized to New York population. This data is taken, 2012 vs all years financial contributions. 2016 presidential election will have different candidates, and thus will vary greatly.We can't make a causality based on the fact that this is observational study.
