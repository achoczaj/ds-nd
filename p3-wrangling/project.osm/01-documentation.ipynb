Or if the users ask *\"I want to eat chicken (Indonesia: Ayam)\"*, the assistant will find restaurant's name with 'Ayam' in it. They will provide these restaurants based on the map location, with user location at the exact center of the map. If the user click on one restaurant, it will be given some pop up that give the description of the restaurant.
